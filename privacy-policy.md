Welcome to AlertaCoin ("we," "us," or "our"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy will inform you how we look after your personal data when you use our mobile application ("Service") and tell you about your privacy rights.

### 1. Who We Are

The data controller responsible for your personal data is AlertaCoin. If you have any questions about this policy, you can contact us through the "Help & Feedback" section in the app.

### 2. The Data We Collect About You

We collect and process the following data to provide and improve our Service:

*   **Account Data:** When you register for an account using Email/Password, Google, or another supported method, we collect a unique User ID provided by Firebase Authentication. We do not store your password. If you register with a third-party service like Google, we receive your basic profile information, such as your email address and name.

*   **User-Generated Content:** We store the content you create within the app, which includes your configured "Single Alerts" and "Alert Groups." This data is linked to your User ID.

*   **Transaction Data:** If you purchase a subscription or make any other in-app purchase, we receive transaction confirmation data from the Google Play Store. **We do not collect or store your payment card details or other sensitive financial information.** This information is handled directly by Google.

*   **Technical & Usage Data:**
    *   **FCM Token:** We collect a Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) token to send you push notifications for the alerts you have configured.
    *   **Advertising ID:** To show you relevant ads, our advertising partner (Google AdMob) may collect your device's Advertising ID. You can reset this ID or opt out of personalized advertising through your device's settings.
    *   **Device Information:** We may automatically collect basic, non-personally identifiable information about your device, such as the device model and operating system version, to troubleshoot bugs and improve the Service.

*   **Feedback Data:** When you submit a request through our "Help & Feedback" feature, we store your message along with your User ID and the diagnostic information displayed (App Version, Device Info) to assist you effectively.

### 3. How We Use Your Personal Data

We use the data we collect for the following purposes:

*   **To Provide and Maintain our Service:** To create and manage your account, store your alerts, and send you push notifications.
*   **To Process Subscriptions:** To verify your in-app purchases and unlock premium features.
*   **To Display Advertising:** To support the free version of our app, we may display ads from third-party networks like Google AdMob. These services may use the data they collect to show you personalized ads.
*   **To Communicate with You:** To respond to your support requests and feedback.
*   **To Improve Our Service:** To understand how our users interact with the app, to diagnose and fix technical problems, and to develop new features.

### 4. How We Share Your Data

We do not sell or rent your personal data to third parties. We only share your data in the following limited circumstances:

*   **With Service Providers:** We use third-party services that are essential for the operation of AlertaCoin, such as:
    *   **Google Firebase / Google Cloud:** For database hosting, user authentication, push notifications (FCM), and analytics.
    *   **Google Play:** To process in-app purchases and subscriptions.
    *   **Google AdMob:** To display advertisements within the app. These providers have their own privacy policies governing how they use data.
*   **For Legal Reasons:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.

### 5. Data Security

We have implemented appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed in an unauthorized way. Data is stored securely within Google's Firebase infrastructure.

### 6. Data Retention

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for. When you delete your account or request data deletion, we will delete your personal data, except for anonymized data used for analytics or data we are required to keep for legal reasons (e.g., transaction records).

### 7. Your Legal Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data, such as the right to request access, correction, or erasure of your data. You can manage your personalized advertising preferences in your device's settings.

To exercise any of your data rights, please contact us through the "Help & Feedback" section in the app.
